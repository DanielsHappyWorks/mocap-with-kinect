The first step to using the Kinect for MoCap purposes is to Install the drives and then plug it in (Microsoft, 2022).

In hindsight that's easy, but I plugged it in and then installed the drivers. Oh boy was a mistake. The lesson here, always read the installation instructions!!!

A bit of unplugging, uninstalling and re-installing later the Kinect sensor turned on, I could see it light up for the first time. The verifier also returned green ticks. I was in!

Cracking open the SDK I was greeted with a connected Kinect that was displaying the depth of the room and assigning bones to my movements.

Now the age old question how do i get this data out and what do I do about the desk taking up most of the cameras view.
