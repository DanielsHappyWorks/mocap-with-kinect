# What is Rokoko Vision?

It is a free AI motion capture tool that can convert recordings up to 15 seconds into animations. To record longer animations without restrictions, the licences start at $20 per month (Rokoko, n.d.).

# The Process

I used the live recording tool, enabled my camera and acted out the fishing scene. The tool then processed the recording and created an animation that I could download.

After recording and exporting the animation as an fbx file, I just followed the process I developed so far. There was no need to learn anything new to use this tool. This was a great time saver as it was compatible with my existing workflow. Below is the end result.

# Evaluation

For a free tool, this has performed better than any free alternative I could get with the Kinect. It isn't as feature rich as some of the paid options but I find that it produced a similar level of animation. For a beginner and indie developer on a budget, this is probably the best approach due to simplicity and price. Even the subscription seems manageable if needed for limited use as 1 month costs less than the Kinect did.

Using the multi-camera setup would probably improve the quality further. Unfortunately I couldn't test this as it requires printing calibration markers and my printer is currently broken.

I also tried using a pre-recorded video and that refused to convert to an animation, buffering endlessly. This seems like a glitch and might have been poor timing but it does make the tool seem a bit unstable.
