Motion capture is expensive. The most well known consumer grade MoCap suit costs â‚¬2,453.85 after tax without any extras like hand tracking ([Rokoko, 2024](#Rokoko)).

For most indie developers this is out of reach so we have to get inventive with how we work.

After a bit of research I found that a lot of people tend to use cameras like the Kinect for simple motion capture ([Autodesk, 2017.](#Autodesk)).
Even though its a bit dated there is a lot of used hardware on the market which could make this a fairly cheap solution in the long run.

The next step is to track down some used Kinects and cables to plug them in.
