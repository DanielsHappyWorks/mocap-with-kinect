To create any 3d artifacts we need to get source material. These sources will help me understand how the animation should look after its produced. I will also be able to compare these sources with the artifact later.

### Source Animations

A parent waiting for their kid

A person walking around the park

A child on a swing

A person fishing in the lake ([Bonfire Fishing, 2021](#Fishing))

I created 3 of the 4 sources but I don't fish so i had to find an online source for this specific animation. Sourcing this was hard as most people take first person video when fishing. I spent a while cutting this video to size as it was too long.
