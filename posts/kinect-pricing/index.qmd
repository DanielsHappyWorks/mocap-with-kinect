When it comes to the Kinect there are two options, the Kinect 360 and the Xbox One Kinect. So one question arises. Which one do i use?

# Kinect 360

The Kinect 360 launched on November 2010 ([Whitworth, 2010](#Whitworth)) as a peripheral that could capture your movement and use it to control your player character in game.

Due to its age its age its discontinued so it has to be bought used.

A used Kinect 360 at CEX costs €1

A cable to connect it to a PC costs €18

The total price is €19

# Xbox One Kinect

The successor to the Kinect 360 is more reliable and improved device with better sensors and field of view.

According to forums online it also stutters less when capturing movement ([Ipisoft, n.d.](#Ipisoft)).

Like the Kinect 360 due to its age its age its discontinued so it has to be bought used.

A used Xbox One Kinect at CEX costs €22

The total price is €52

# Conclusion

When compared to a MoCap suit both prices seem like a no brainier. Since I'm willing to spend a bit more I chose to use the Kinect for the Xbox One for this project.
