The last two weeks has been spent outlining the artifact for the project. As part of the artifact I will create 4 animations for my game “A Walk in the Park”.

The 4 animations will include: 

1.  A parent waiting for their kid 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  A person walking around the park 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  A person fishing in the lake 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
4.  A child on a swing – I will rock in a chair to simulate this! 

The outline can be found [here](/outline.html).
