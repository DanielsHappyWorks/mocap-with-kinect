I spent a lot of time going through interesting ideas for this project evaluating all possible angles, all the way from pre to post production.

In the end i settled on "Motion Capture On a Budget"

- This would require finding a way to capture movement and apply it to the existing Mixamo rig.
- Motion capture is not cost effective so maybe some investigation could be done on how to do this on a budget.
- If this works i could use it to speed up my character animating workflows.
- There is also some possible use cases for AI here.

My Other Ideas included:

-   Character Rigging - Animal

    This would require creating a character, ideally an animal and rigging it with bones from scratch to create a short animation.
    Form this I could learn about how rigging works with a more basic creature. It would also allow me some time to understand how animals move.

-   Character Cloth Simulation - Cape!

    My character in the previous project has been very rigid with skin tight clothing.
    I would like to learn how to evolve this and i think clothing physics might be the way to go.
    For this project i would try to give my character a physics simulated cape.

-   Fluid Simulations - Honey/Water

    This topic has brilliant Research papers!
    Figuring out how liquids should behave can add great realism to games and animations.
    For this project I would probably try to siulate honey or water in real time.

-   Rendering - Ray Tracing?

-   Project Management for production pipelines Create a re-usable repository of models Repository of models for boxing layouts

-   Modelling Topology {{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV3mhvWpppM >}}

-   Procedural Textures {{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPI9xq41nOk >}}

-   Color Correction - Use old renders to see if they can be improved!

-   Compositing - use a previous scene to compose elements into an image to improve rendering times?
