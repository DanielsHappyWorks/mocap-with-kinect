Went from PRE-PRODUCTION all the way to POST-PRODUCTION

Nightmare Fuel:
VTuber Rigging/Motion Capture - AI?
Character Cloth Simulation - Cape!
Fluid Simulations - Honey/Water - Good Research papers! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX84nGi-V7E
Rendering - Ray Tracing? Efficient VR rendering/lighting

Easy Mode:
Project Management for production pipelines
	Create a re-usable repository of models
	Repository of models for boxing layouts
Modelling Topology https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX84nGi-V7E
Procedurally Generated Texture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPI9xq41nOk

Ehhhhh:
Efficient story boarding for production
Character (Animal) Modelling
UV unwrapping Textures
Color Correction - Use old renders to see if they can be improved!
Compositing - use a previous scene to compose elements into an image to improve rendering times?
