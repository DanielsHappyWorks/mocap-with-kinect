    "text": "Motion capture is expensive. The most well known consumer grade MoCap suit costs €2,453.85 after tax without any extras like hand tracking (Rokoko, 2024). \nFor most indie developers this is out of reach so we have to get inventive with how we work.\nAfter a bit of research I found that a lot of people tend to use cameras like the Kinect for simple motion capture (Autodesk, 2017.). Even though its a bit dated there is a lot of used hardware on the market which could make this a fairly cheap solution in the long run.\nThe next step is to track down some used Kinects and cables to plug them in.\n\nReferences\n1.Rokoko (2024) Smartsuit Pro II.

    "text": "When it comes to the Kinect there are two options, the Kinect 360 and the Xbox One Kinect. So one question arises. Which one do i use?\n\nKinect 360\nThe Kinect 360 launched on November 2010 (Whitworth, 2010) as a peripheral that could capture your movement and use it to control your player character in game.\nDue to its age its age its discontinued so it has to be bought used.\nA used Kinect 360 at CEX costs €1 \nA cable to connect it to a PC costs €18 \nThe total price is €19\n\n\nXbox One Kinect\nThe successor to the Kinect 360 is more reliable and improved device with better sensors and field of view.\nAccording to forums online it also stutters less when capturing movement (Ipisoft, n.d.).\nLike the Kinect 360 due to its age its age its discontinued so it has to be bought used.\nA used Xbox One Kinect at CEX costs €22 \nA cable to connect it to a PC costs €30 \nThe total price is €52\n\n\nConclusion\nWhen compared to a MoCap suit both prices seem like a no brainier. Since I’m willing to spend a bit more I chose to use the Kinect for the Xbox One for this project.\n\n\nReferences\n1.Whitworth, D. (2010) Kinect gets UK release date, BBC News.

    "text": "I spent a lot of time going through interesting ideas for this project evaluating all possible angles, all the way from pre to post production.\nIn the end i settled on “Motion Capture On a Budget”\n\nThis would require finding a way to capture movement and apply it to the existing Mixamo rig.\nMotion capture is not cost effective so maybe some investigation could be done on how to do this on a budget.\nIf this works i could use it to speed up my character animating workflows.\nThere is also some possible use cases for AI here.\n\nMy Other Ideas included:\n\nCharacter Rigging - Animal\nThis would require creating a character, ideally an animal and rigging it with bones from scratch to create a short animation. Form this I could learn about how rigging works with a more basic creature. It would also allow me some time to understand how animals move. \nCharacter Cloth Simulation - Cape!\nMy character in the previous project has been very rigid with skin tight clothing. I would like to learn how to evolve this and i think clothing physics might be the way to go. For this project i would try to give my character a physics simulated cape. \nFluid Simulations - Honey/Water\nThis topic has brilliant Research papers! Figuring out how liquids should behave can add great realism to games and animations. For this project I would probably try to siulate honey or water in real time. \nRendering - Ray Tracing\nI considered making a simple real time ray tracer but this is more of a coding project and I don’t think it fits well with the specification. It would be a great for learning how textures and models are rendered\nCreate a re-usable repository of models Repository of models for boxing layouts\nTo speed up blocking and better understand the space I’m working with a repository of simple models that are scaled 1:1 with each other would be very useful. The idea has a lot of potential for improving the design process.\nModelling Topology\nTopology is hard. Great topology is harder. The only way to get good is to practice. For this project I would research and compile the best practices for topology and try to apply them to a complicated model.\n\nProcedural Textures\nThere is something fascinating about procedural textures. You can make about anything. The goal with this project is to understand the steps needed to create my own custom textures.\n\nColor Correction\nUse old renders to see if they can be improved with color correction. This would at another tool to my arsenal of existing skills.\nCompositing\nUse a previous scene to compose elements into an image to improve rendering times. I actively avoided compositing before as I believe its a waste of time for smaller 3D projects but this needs to change if I am to understand the 3D pipeline."

    "text": "Rationale \nAs a solo creator, I want to be able to produce content with an acceptable level of quality quickly with limited budget. Animation takes a lot of time, research, in-depth studies of real life and practice. I believe a part of this process could be simplified with motion capture when animating characters, but full body motion capture is too expensive for the average person with limited resources. \nAs part of this project, I aim to find a way to create character animations of a reasonable quality with a limited budget faster than it would take me to record source materials and animate them manually. \nFrom initial research it seems like the Kinect is my best bet as many people have used it for the same reasons in the past. It’s well documented and should be easy to set up. As some alternatives I may also compare this to AI based approaches based on time constraints. \n\n\nLiterature \n\nOnline resources: \n\nResources for investigating technology to use on a budget: \n\nRokoko (2024) Smartsuit Pro II.

O’Reilly Media, Inc. https://www.google.ie/books/edition/Kinect_Hacks/VsmK1Kt8oJcC?hl=en&gbpv=0 \n\n\n\n\nKey terms \n\nKinect – Relates specifically to Xbox One Kinect Sensor. It is a console accessory composed of multiple cameras that can discern depth. It is used for body tracking in video games. \nMotion Capture - Process of recording the movement of objects or people and applying them to 3d models. \nBudget – Amount of money dedicated for a spending. In this case it refers to spending as little as possible. \nSkeleton/Rig – Similar to a real skeleton. It is the bones that make up the virtual character and constrain their movements. \nRigging – Technique used to animate the skeleton. \nOpen Source – Publicly available code that can be redistributed and modified. \nSDK – Stands for Software Development Kit. Allows for the creation of applications using APIs defined by the provider. In this case Microsoft provides an SDK for the Kinect. \n\n\n\nQuestions to be addressed \nCan cheap motion capture tools be used to create adequate animations for game development on a budget? \nHow good is Kinect as an option for cheap motion capture? \nWhat are the limitations of cheap motion capture solutions like the Kinect? \n\n\nMethodology \n\nGeneral approach \nI will create a game as part of the other modules and insert the animations from this research to create an artifact. \nThis will involve recording and exporting animations from the Kinect to UE5. \nLastly, I will test the game with users and see what they think of the animations. \n\n\nSubjects\nReal life people that do the same actions I will try to emulate in the Kinect based animations.\n\n\nMethods\n\nCreate sources for the listed animations I want to make \nI will set up the Kinect for the Xbox One and setup the SDK. \nRecord an animation using the Kinect SDK while trying to emulate the sources. \nExtract the skeleton data from the recording and migrate it to a format I can use in blender. \nMap the skeleton animation to a Mixamo character & skeleton. \nExport the animation and use it in the game. \nCompare the animations to the sources and evaluate the success of the project. \nTest the game with users to see if the animations are good enough to be immersive in the environment. \n\n\n\nLimitations \nI will be only using one Kinect and open-source software for budget reasons. \n\n\n\nOutline of Projected Results \nI expect I will be able to create 4 animations that will be used as part of a game called “A Walk in the Park”. This game will be made as part of software engineering and sound modules. The animations should be usable but based on initial research using just one Kinect camera could cause some issues with quality of the animations.\nThe 4 animations will include: \n\nA parent waiting for their kid \nA person walking around the park \nA person fishing in the lake \nA child on a swing – I will rock in a chair to simulate this! \n\nThe timeline for this is defined in the gantt chart below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Conclusions and Implications \nHopefully I will be able to create good enough animations to use in a game. Using one Kinect could be a limitation that I may not be able to overcome easily but I can always leverage more if needed. This will be a last resort as the concept behind this project is to work on a budget. The same applies to paid software. I will try to use free or open-source applications unless issues arise."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Budget Hike\nAfter evaluating my options, I decided to opt for paid software. Between iPi and Brekel, the choice was obviously Brekel for the price. For the pricing of iPi, I would start considering a Rokoko suit instead. For the purpose of this project, I will try to make do with the trial to avoid incurring additional expenses.\nThis brings the total to €190.67 with the hardware costs of €52.87 and Brekel Body V2/V3 costing €137.80.\nIf I wanted more accuracy, I would need to spend €382.26 on 2 Kinects and €276.52 on Brekel with Multi-Sensor support. With this budget, maybe it’s time to start considering actual mocap solutions like Rokoko.\n\n\nProgress with Brekel\nWith Brekel v2 Body, I created an fbx animation within minutes. There were no issues importing it to Blender. The orientation was correct and the animation was easily mapped onto the Mixamo rig. Issues with jittering were resolved by the software at recording time. The only thing I needed to adjust for the walk cycle was the positioning but that was done the same way as the previous approach. The software has a lot of settings so the animations may be even better with more time to tinker.\n\nOnce I had the animation, I wanted to see it in UE5. I needed to see the end-to-end pipeline working before I would consider this a success. And guess what, another problem arose. The animations didn’t import correctly at all. It looked like the model collapsed in on itself.\n\nFortunately for me, this was a Blender issue. The scaling between Blender and UE5 is different so UE5 was treating the bones as tiny on the animation I was importing. I resolved it with the help of this video by:\n\nChanging unit scale from 1 to 0.01\nScaling the rig by 100 in every direction\nApplying the scaling (Ctrl+A & Apply Scaling)\nImport again with success\n\n\nNot all issues have been fixed by this approach but it’s much more streamlined and efficient. Sideways/Back animations are still a big problem as they require multiple Kinects to fix but the software is more expensive if you want to use those. With the goal of being on a budget, I will not try to resolve this as part of the project.\n\n\nReferences\n1.Brekel (2024) Brekel Body V2, Brekel.

    "text": "Opening up the Kinect SDK and KinectAnimationStudio I was able to very quickly export a walking animation to an fbx file. This is unfortunately where I hit my first road block. Blender was complaining that the fbx file was ASCII encoded and could not be read.\n\nTo fix this I used Autodesk FBX Converter 2013. It’s a legacy piece of software but it got the job done, allowing Blender to open the animation.\nWhen I got the animation open in Blender, I noticed a few things.\n\nThere was a lot of jitter in the animation.\nThe animation was exported at a weird angle, and was walking up and down.\nThere were less bones then I expected.\nWhen recording, facing away from the camera caused the bones to distort widely.\n\n\nThere seemed to be a few more problems then anticipated so I decided to map the animation to a Mixamo character. I tried to do this by re-targeting the animation using the Rokoko Blender plugin. This is where the true Eldrich horrors started. The mapping was applying the character to the correct bones but in the wrong orientation and the constraints & weights seemed to distort the character to no end.\n\nIn the end, I only solved problem 2 by removing the animation’s rotation and position on the hips. Unfortunately I still had 4 problems left and one of them was the bones themselves.\nThis video playlist indicates what I am trying to do is possible. It should be possible to use these exported bones but the issues that arise and effort required to fix them is probably not worth it. My knowledge of rigging is not good enough to fully understand what is being done here.\nAt this point, I need to reconsider my approach. Maybe using paid software would be the easier way out if I want to use characters from Mixamo and not have to rig them myself.\n\nReferences\n1.Furtado, M. (no date) Kinectanimationstudio.

The animations were all broken. They looked fine in blender but acted weird in UE5.\nFortunately, this was only a scaling problem between blender and UE5 and once I solved this, I was able to see the animation properly. For more information, see the Brekel blog entry."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Idle & Swinging Animation\nFor both animations, I followed the process I defined in the previous blog. I took the Brekel animations into Blender to fix up what I could and then imported them into UE5.\nI had some issues with the idle animation recording. I had to make something simpler in the end as crossing my arms caused the hands to go all over the place.\n\nFor the swinging animation, I used my chair. This worked out better than expected. The Kinect didn’t seem too happy with my feet not being on the floor and my hands didn’t stay perfectly in place but it still turned out well. I think the Swinging animation worked out better than the Idle animation.\n\nThe loop on both animations isn’t great but it’s very hard to time the loop when working within the 10 second animation limit of the Brekel trial.\n\n\nAnimation Integration\nWhen importing the Idle animation to UE5, I encountered some issues. Multiple animations were exported even though I only saw the one in Blender. I would see the original Mixamo animation and all the Brekel animations I imported and re-targeted. I left it alone for the Idle but knew it was something I needed to figure out.\n\nDuring the exporting of the Swing animation, the same problem occurred. This time, I decided to spend the time to figure it out. Turns out Blender just un-links the animations instead of deleting them when they are removed from a skeleton (Forwood, 2020). UE5 imports all of them as they get exported in the .fbx file.\nThe solution to the problem was:\n\nOpen the Action Editor\nOrphan the animations using Shift + X icon beside the animation list \nThe animation will now be marked with an O symbol.\nSave and restart blender (This step baffles me with confusion, the animations are cleaned up on application exit which is just stupid)\nExport the animation\n\nThe animations were then added to blueprints in UE5 and were officially embedded in the game.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nForwood, A.

It’s peaceful, and the fact that it is interactive is a lot of fun. Rated it down a bit because there are some areas which could use some improvement, e.g. lack of audio, some glitching with the animations and a river you can fall into with no way out.\nIt’s a very vibrant and colourful park. It’s peaceful, and the fact that it is interactive is a lot of fun. Rated it down a bit because there are some areas which could use some improvement, e.g. lack of audio, some glitching with the animations and a river you can fall into with no way out.\nThe animations of the other people were scary\n\nAs grim as this feedback seems the scores for visuals are still really good.\n\n\n\nReflections\nI agree with the users that the animations are a bit glitchy causing them to be unsettling. This unfortunately has a lot to do with my inability to record more than 10 seconds at time in Brekel causing me to rush but at the same time the quality that Brekel produces can be inadequate and rough around the edges with my current setup.\nThe animations are also not a perfect loop so if you look at them enough you will see the issues. I did my best to get as close to perfect as possible but I don’t have the time and skills to make the animations seamless. This is a rereach project of its own and is also contributing to the issues mentioned by the users."
