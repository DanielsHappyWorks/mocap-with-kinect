    "text": "Motion capture is expensive. The most well known consumer grade MoCap suit costs €2,453.85 after tax without any extras like hand tracking (Rokoko, 2024). \nFor most indie developers this is out of reach so we have to get inventive with how we work.\nAfter a bit of research I found that a lot of people tend to use cameras like the Kinect for simple motion capture (Autodesk, 2017.). Even though its a bit dated there is a lot of used hardware on the market which could make this a fairly cheap solution in the long run.\nThe next step is to track down some used Kinects and cables to plug them in.\n\nReferences\n1.Rokoko (2024) Smartsuit Pro II.

    "text": "When it comes to the Kinect there are two options, the Kinect 360 and the Xbox One Kinect. So one question arises. Which one do i use?\n\nKinect 360\nThe Kinect 360 launched on November 2010 (Whitworth, 2010) as a peripheral that could capture your movement and use it to control your player character in game.\nDue to its age its age its discontinued so it has to be bought used.\nA used Kinect 360 at CEX costs €1 \nA cable to connect it to a PC costs €18 \nThe total price is €19\n\n\nXbox One Kinect\nThe successor to the Kinect 360 is more reliable and improved device with better sensors and field of view.\nAccording to forums online it also stutters less when capturing movement (Ipisoft, n.d.).\nLike the Kinect 360 due to its age its age its discontinued so it has to be bought used.\nA used Xbox One Kinect at CEX costs €22 \nA cable to connect it to a PC costs €30 \nThe total price is €52\n\n\nConclusion\nWhen compared to a MoCap suit both prices seem like a no brainier. Since I’m willing to spend a bit more I chose to use the Kinect for the Xbox One for this project.\n\n\nReferences\n1.Whitworth, D. (2010) Kinect gets UK release date, BBC News.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I spent a lot of time going through interesting ideas for this project evaluating all possible angles, all the way from pre to post production.\nIn the end i settled on “Motion Capture On a Budget”\n\nThis would require finding a way to capture movement and apply it to the existing Mixamo rig.\nMotion capture is not cost effective so maybe some investigation could be done on how to do this on a budget.\nIf this works i could use it to speed up my character animating workflows.\nThere is also some possible use cases for AI here.\n\nMy Other Ideas included:\n\nCharacter Rigging - Animal\nThis would require creating a character, ideally an animal and rigging it with bones from scratch to create a short animation. Form this I could learn about how rigging works with a more basic creature. It would also allow me some time to understand how animals move. \nCharacter Cloth Simulation - Cape!\nMy character in the previous project has been very rigid with skin tight clothing. I would like to learn how to evolve this and i think clothing physics might be the way to go. For this project i would try to give my character a physics simulated cape. \nFluid Simulations - Honey/Water\nThis topic has brilliant Research papers! Figuring out how liquids should behave can add great realism to games and animations. For this project I would probably try to siulate honey or water in real time. \nRendering - Ray Tracing\nI considered making a simple real time ray tracer but this is more of a coding project and I don’t think it fits well with the specification. It would be a great for learning how textures and models are rendered\nCreate a re-usable repository of models Repository of models for boxing layouts\nTo speed up blocking and better understand the space I’m working with a repository of simple models that are scaled 1:1 with each other would be very useful. The idea has a lot of potential for improving the design process.\nModelling Topology\nTopology is hard. Great topology is harder. The only way to get good is to practice. For this project I would research and compile the best practices for topology and try to apply them to a complicated model.\n\nProcedural Textures\nThere is something fascinating about procedural textures. You can make about anything. The goal with this project is to understand the steps needed to create my own custom textures.\n\nColor Correction\nUse old renders to see if they can be improved with color correction. This would at another tool to my arsenal of existing skills.\nCompositing\nUse a previous scene to compose elements into an image to improve rendering times. I actively avoided compositing before as I believe its a waste of time for smaller 3D projects but this needs to change if I am to understand the 3D pipeline."

    "text": "Rationale \nAs a solo creator, I want to be able to produce content with an acceptable level of quality quickly with limited budget. Animation takes a lot of time, research, in-depth studies of real life and practice. I believe a part of this process could be simplified with motion capture when animating characters, but full body motion capture is too expensive for the average person with limited resources. \nAs part of this project, I aim to find a way to create character animations of a reasonable quality with a limited budget faster than it would take me to record source materials and animate them manually. \nFrom initial research it seems like the Kinect is my best bet as many people have used it for the same reasons in the past. It’s well documented and should be easy to set up. As some alternatives I may also compare this to AI based approaches based on time constraints. \n\n\nLiterature \n\nOnline resources: \n\n\nResources for investigating technology to use on a budget: \n\nRokoko (2024) Smartsuit Pro II.

O’Reilly Media, Inc. https://www.google.ie/books/edition/Kinect_Hacks/VsmK1Kt8oJcC?hl=en&gbpv=0 \n\n\n\n\nKey terms \n\nKinect – Relates specifically to Xbox One Kinect Sensor. It is a console accessory composed of multiple cameras that can discern depth. It is used for body tracking in video games. \n\n\n\nMotion Capture - Process of recording the movement of objects or people and applying them to 3d models. \n\n\n\nBudget – Amount of money dedicated for a spending. In this case it refers to spending as little as possible. \n\n\n\nSkeleton/Rig – Similar to a real skeleton. It is the bones that make up the virtual character and constrain their movements. \n\n\n\nRigging – Technique used to animate the skeleton. \n\n\n\nOpen Source – Publicly available code that can be redistributed and modified. \n\n\n\nSDK – Stands for Software Development Kit. Allows for the creation of applications using APIs defined by the provider. In this case Microsoft provides an SDK for the Kinect. \n\n\n\nQuestions to be addressed \nCan cheap motion capture tools be used to create adequate animations for game development on a budget? \nHow good is Kinect as an option for cheap motion capture? \nWhat are the limitations of cheap motion capture solutions like the Kinect? \n\n\nMethodology \n\nGeneral approach \nI will create a game as part of the other modules and insert the animations from this research to create an artifact. \nThis will involve recording and exporting animations from the Kinect to UE5. \nLastly, I will test the game with users and see what they think of the animations. \n\n\nSubjects\nReal life people that do the same actions I will try to emulate in the Kinect based animations.\n\n\nMethods\n\nCreate sources for the listed animations I want to make \n\n\n\nI will set up the Kinect for the Xbox One and setup the SDK. \n\n\n\nRecord an animation using the Kinect SDK while trying to emulate the sources. \n\n\n\nExtract the skeleton data from the recording and migrate it to a format I can use in blender. \n\n\n\nMap the skeleton animation to a Mixamo character & skeleton. \n\n\n\nExport the animation and use it in the game. \n\n\n\nCompare the animations to the sources and evaluate the success of the project. \n\n\n\nTest the game with users to see if the animations are good enough to be immersive in the environment. \n\n\n\nLimitations \nI will be only using one Kinect and open-source software for budget reasons. \n\n\n\nOutline of Projected Results \nI expect I will be able to create 4 animations that will be used as part of a game called “A Walk in the Park”. This game will be made as part of software engineering and sound modules. The animations should be usable but based on initial research using just one Kinect camera could cause some issues with quality of the animations.\nThe 4 animations will include: \n\nA parent waiting for their kid \n\n\n\nA person walking around the park \n\n\n\nA person fishing in the lake \n\n\n\nA child on a swing – I will rock in a chair to simulate this! \n\nThe timeline for this is defined in the gantt chart below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Conclusions and Implications \nHopefully I will be able to create good enough animations to use in a game. Using one Kinect could be a limitation that I may not be able to overcome easily but I can always leverage more if needed. This will be a last resort as the concept behind this project is to work on a budget. The same applies to paid software. I will try to use free or open-source applications unless issues arise."

I’ve never actually done these calculations before and they are neat. I used the standard unit price for electricity from my provider and price of filament from when i bought it months ago.\n\nI mounded the Kinect to the stand using zip ties that were laying around since I didn’t have the right screws.
