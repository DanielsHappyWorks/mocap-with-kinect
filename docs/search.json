    "text": "Motion capture is expensive. The most well known consumer grade MoCap suit costs €2,453.85 after tax without any extras like hand tracking (Rokoko, 2024). \nFor most indie developers this is out of reach so we have to get inventive with how we work.\nAfter a bit of research I found that a lot of people tend to use cameras like the Kinect for simple motion capture (Autodesk, 2017.). Even though its a bit dated there is a lot of used hardware on the market which could make this a fairly cheap solution in the long run.\nThe next step is to track down some used Kinects and cables to plug them in.\n\nReferences\n1.Rokoko (2024) Smartsuit Pro II.

    "text": "When it comes to the Kinect there are two options, the Kinect 360 and the Xbox One Kinect. So one question arises. Which one do i use?\n\nKinect 360\nThe Kinect 360 launched on November 2010 (Whitworth, 2010) as a peripheral that could capture your movement and use it to control your player character in game.\nDue to its age its age its discontinued so it has to be bought used.\nA used Kinect 360 at CEX costs €1 \nA cable to connect it to a PC costs €18 \nThe total price is €19\n\n\nXbox One Kinect\nThe successor to the Kinect 360 is more reliable and improved device with better sensors and field of view.\nAccording to forums online it also stutters less when capturing movement (Ipisoft, n.d.).\nLike the Kinect 360 due to its age its age its discontinued so it has to be bought used.\nA used Xbox One Kinect at CEX costs €22 \nA cable to connect it to a PC costs €30 \nThe total price is €52\n\n\nConclusion\nWhen compared to a MoCap suit both prices seem like a no brainier. Since I’m willing to spend a bit more I chose to use the Kinect for the Xbox One for this project.\n\n\nReferences\n1.Whitworth, D. (2010) Kinect gets UK release date, BBC News.

    "title": "Brainstorming Ideas",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I spent a lot of time going through interesting ideas for this project evaluating all possible angles, all the way from pre to post production.\nIn the end i settled on “Motion Capture On a Budget”\n\nThis would require finding a way to capture movement and apply it to the existing Mixamo rig.\nMotion capture is not cost effective so maybe some investigation could be done on how to do this on a budget.\nIf this works i could use it to speed up my character animating workflows.\nThere is also some possible use cases for AI here.\n\nMy Other Ideas included:\n\nCharacter Rigging - Animal\nThis would require creating a character, ideally an animal and rigging it with bones from scratch to create a short animation. Form this I could learn about how rigging works with a more basic creature. It would also allow me some time to understand how animals move. \nCharacter Cloth Simulation - Cape!\nMy character in the previous project has been very rigid with skin tight clothing. I would like to learn how to evolve this and i think clothing physics might be the way to go. For this project i would try to give my character a physics simulated cape. \nFluid Simulations - Honey/Water\nThis topic has brilliant Research papers! Figuring out how liquids should behave can add great realism to games and animations. For this project I would probably try to siulate honey or water in real time. \nRendering - Ray Tracing\nI considered making a simple real time ray tracer but this is more of a coding project and I don’t think it fits well with the specification. It would be a great for learning how textures and models are rendered\nCreate a re-usable repository of models Repository of models for boxing layouts\nTo speed up blocking and better understand the space I’m working with a repository of simple models that are scaled 1:1 with each other would be very useful. The idea has a lot of potential for improving the design process.\nModelling Topology\nTopology is hard. Great topology is harder. The only way to get good is to practice. For this project I would research and compile the best practices for topology and try to apply them to a complicated model.\n\nProcedural Textures\nThere is something fascinating about procedural textures. You can make about anything. The goal with this project is to understand the steps needed to create my own custom textures.\n\nColor Correction\nUse old renders to see if they can be improved with color correction. This would at another tool to my arsenal of existing skills.\nCompositing\nUse a previous scene to compose elements into an image to improve rendering times. I actively avoided compositing before as I believe its a waste of time for smaller 3D projects but this needs to change if I am to understand the 3D pipeline."

The Xbox one kinect can be mounted using any standard tripod mount making it easier to work with.\nI have a few options here:\n\nMount it on the wall\nMount it on a tripod\nMount it on the monitor\n\nI like option 3 as its not permanent and i can easily 3d print a stand myself not incurring much cost in the process as all existing mounting solutions have been discontinued and i don’t own any tripods.\nOnline I found the perfect mount that would work for my monitor (Benas09, 2020).\n\nAfter cost calculation the stand worked out to be €0.87 which is extremely cheap (Prusa Calculator, n.d.). I’ve never actually done these calculations before and they are neat. I used the standard unit price for electricity from my provider and price of filament from when i bought it months ago.\n\nI mounded the Kinect to the stand using zip ties that were laying around since I didn’t have the right screws. It held stable on the monitor.\n\nNow for the moment of truth.\n\nIt worked I can do full body capture, now the question is how!\n\nReferences\n1.Benas09 (2020) Kinect2 Mount to Samsung Flat TV, Thingiverse.
