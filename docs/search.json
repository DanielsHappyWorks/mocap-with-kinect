    "text": "I spent a lot of time going through interesting ideas for this project evaluating all possible angles, all the way from pre to post production.\nIn the end i settled on “Motion Capture On a Budget”\n\nThis would require finding a way to capture movement and apply it to the existing Mixamo rig.\nMotion capture is not cost effective so maybe some investigation could be done on how to do this on a budget.\nIf this works i could use it to speed up my character animating workflows.\nThere is also some possible use cases for AI here.\n\nMy Other Ideas included:\n\nCharacter Rigging - Animal\nThis would require creating a character, ideally an animal and rigging it with bones from scratch to create a short animation. Form this I could learn about how rigging works with a more basic creature. It would also allow me some time to understand how animals move.\n\nCharacter Cloth Simulation - Cape!\nMy character in the previous project has been very rigid with skin tight clothing. I would like to learn how to evolve this and i think clothing physics might be the way to go. For this project i would try to give my character a physics simulated cape.\n\nFluid Simulations - Honey/Water\nThis topic has brilliant Research papers! Figuring out how liquids should behave can add great realism to games and animations. For this project I would probably try to siulate honey or water in real time.\n\nRendering - Ray Tracing?\nProject Management for production pipelines Create a re-usable repository of models Repository of models for boxing layouts\nModelling Topology \nProcedural Textures \nColor Correction - Use old renders to see if they can be improved!\nCompositing - use a previous scene to compose elements into an image to improve rendering times?"
