# Introduction

Brief overview of your research topic and area of interest.

# Special Area of Interest

Define and explain your chosen 3D production area.

# Research Context & Literature

Summarize literature and previous work on the topic.

# Research Plan

Methodology and steps for how youâ€™ll carry out the project.

# Artefact Concept

Initial idea of the artefact you will produce to demonstrate your research.

# Timeline

I have already completed some of the work over the summer to figure out what I will be researching.

```{r, include = FALSE}
install.packages("ganttrify",
  repos = c(
    "https://giocomai.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)

library("ganttrify")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
funky_project <- tibble::tribble(
  ~wp, ~activity, ~start_date, ~end_date,
  "Before Semester", "Brainstorming", "2024-06-01", "2024-06-23",
  "Before Semester", "Start Blogging", "2024-06-20", "2024-8-2",
  "Before Semester", "Initial Research", "2024-06-23", "2024-8-2",
)

ganttrify(
  project = funky_project,
  project_start_date = "2024-06",
  by_date = TRUE,
  exact_date = TRUE,
  font_family = "Roboto Condensed"
) +
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Work done over the summer")
```

Now I will focus on creating my artifact that has been defined as part of creating the outline.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
funky_project <- tibble::tribble(
  ~wp, ~activity, ~start_date, ~end_date,
